# Train-Time

## Summary

This app is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains the user adds, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

It also allows the user to enter the time a train route starts sending out trains and how often a train departs in order to find out when is the next train the user could possibly take.
